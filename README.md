### Notes to Self

- Use `sudo systemctl start postgresql.service` to check if PostgreSQL is runnning
- WSL doesn't have `systemctl start postgresql.service`, so use `service postgresql start`
- When using MikroORM, put all new `entity`s in the init and make a new entity definition file
- This does not automatically create the entity table in PostgreSQL
  - Use CLI to create migrations. Then add code to run migration in `main`
- Sometimes, Apollo resolvers need access to `ORM`
- Tuto said I need `import 'reflect-metadata'` in index.ts, but it's working without so far...
  - Though, GQL does require it, so I guess I'll do it
- To handle user sessions:
  - On login, store a cookie in user browser
